# Customer Segmentation for Ecommerce

Analysing customer behaviour over time helps to predict what kind of products a customer will purchase. Companies use this idea of customer segmentation extensively to boost sales. The goal of this project is to analyse customer behaviour using various techniques and derive inferences about customers with a motive to segment customers into best possible groups. 

Such a classification is performed using various available techniques and algorithms and the quality of these predictions is tested and the precision of each algorithm is compared.
